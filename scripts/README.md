##Python Optimizers  
- ParOpt - uses either grid search or Nelderâ€“Mead to minimize an objective function derived from a command-line tool.


Abyss_wrapper.py uses a python system call to run Abyss. It parses the ouput to report only the value of N50 (contiguity)

One can then use ParOpt to optimize k using a grid search - ParOpt will then tell you the optimum value, k.

```time ../ParOpt/popt --grid max 'ParOpt/Abyss_wrapper.py {0}' 'fx = (.*)' 25,30,1```

Output:


``` 
    0 f(2.500e+01) = 604.0
    1 f(2.600e+01) = 994.0
    2 f(2.700e+01) = 869.0
    3 f(2.800e+01) = 793.0
    4 f(2.900e+01) = 669.0
Finished optimization after 5 evaluations.
The optimal function value is -994.000000000000000000000000000000
Optimal variables: 26

real	0m58.372s
user	0m59.701s
sys	0m2.839s

```

Next steps:
- It is possible to run ParOpt without the need of a wrapper function. A well defined regular expression for the Abyss.log should work with ParOpt. This was intially avoided as N50 is reported in exactly the same format in two parts of the log.
- Implement the Mead-nelder algorithm. At the moment - ParOpt gives deciminal values for each iteration (k=30.4) doesn't make sense. Force it to take integer values.
